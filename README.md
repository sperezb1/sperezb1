# The Effect of Trade on Deforestation in South America: An Empirical and Qualitative study

Does the trade of commodities cause deforestation in South America? In this paper, I inspect this question by running a quantitative analysis utilizing fixed-effects regressions. My preliminary results show that there is a positive but statistically insignificant effect of commodity exports and agricultural land usage in South America for most types of land, looking at arable, permanent crops, and permanent meadows.
